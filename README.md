## 🌍 About Me

I’m a **self-taught backend developer** from Russia, coding since **age 12**. Currently in my **3rd year of college** (graduating in 2027), I’ve built a strong foundation in **Java, Spring Boot, JPA, and Thymeleaf** through hands-on projects and focused learning (thanks to Гоша Дударь and relentless practice!).

My dream? To **join Norway’s IT industry** as a junior Java developer after graduation — work in a team that values clean code, grow professionally, and one day live near the fjords in a small house surrounded by nature.
